             "responses":["\nThe steps to perform CPR: \n1.Check for responsiveness: Shake the person gently and ask loudly, 'Are you okay?' If there is no response, the person is unresponsive, and you need to initiate CPR. \n2.Call for help: Shout for someone nearby to call emergency services or do it yourself if you are alone. If an automated external defibrillator (AED) is available, send someone to retrieve it. \n3.Positioning: Place the person on a firm, flat surface. Ensure they are lying on their back and are not on any hazardous or uneven surfaces. \n4.Hand placement: Kneel beside the person's chest. Place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest, between the nipples. Place your other hand on top, interlocking your fingers. Keep your arms straight and your shoulders directly above your hands. \n5.Compression technique: Start chest compressions by pushing hard and fast at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute. Allow the chest to fully recoil between compressions. Aim for a compression depth of about 2 inches (5 centimeters) for adults. \n6.Rescue breaths: After 30 compressions, open the person's airway by tilting their head back and lifting the chin. Pinch the person's nose closed and cover their mouth with yours, creating an airtight seal. Give two rescue breaths lasting about 1 second each. Watch for the person's chest to rise with each breath. \n7.Repeat cycles: Continue the cycle of 30 compressions followed by 2 rescue breaths. Maintain the compression-to-breath ratio of 30:2 until help arrives, an AED becomes available, the person shows signs of life, or you are too exhausted to continue. \n8.Use of an AED: If an AED arrives, turn it on and follow the voice prompts. Apply the pads to the person's bare chest as indicated and allow the AED to analyze the heart rhythm. If advised, deliver a shock by pressing the appropriate button. After delivering the shock, resume CPR starting with chest compressions. \n9.Continue until help arrives: Keep performing CPR until emergency medical services arrive and take over, or the person shows signs of life, such as breathing, coughing, or moving."]
